Simple Shell - Project 0x16
This project, titled "Simple Shell," involves the creation of a simple UNIX command interpreter. It's a group project by Julien Barbier, emphasizing fundamental programming concepts, C basics, and engineering thinking. The project's weight is 10 and should be completed in teams of two, with Respect Masehla and Wayne Rufaro as the assigned team for this instance.

Important Dates
Start Date: November 1, 2023, 6:00 AM
End Date: November 16, 2023, 6:00 AM
Checker Release: November 15, 2023, 1:12 AM
Auto-review: Will launch at the deadline
Concepts Covered
The project expects an understanding of:

Creation of a custom shell
Approach to project development
Teamwork dynamics and collaboration
Usage of Docker & WSL for a smoother development experience
Background Context
The project's foundation lies in creating a simple UNIX command interpreter, as outlined in "The Gates of Shell" by Spencer Cheng, featuring Julien Barbier. Julien stresses the importance of individual understanding and learning without resorting to code copying or shortcuts. Emphasis is placed on learning the process rather than finding immediate solutions.

Learning Objectives
At the project's conclusion, participants are expected to explain without external help:

Key figures in UNIX history
Basics of shell operation
Process IDs (pid) and parent process IDs (ppid)
Environment manipulation for the current process
Difference between functions and system calls
Process creation and suspension
Usage of execve system call to execute programs
Handling EOF (end-of-file)
Requirements & Guidelines
Code should follow the Betty style
No memory leaks allowed
Limited functions per file
Use of system calls only when necessary
README.md and AUTHORS file are mandatory
Collaboration via a single GitHub repository per group
Allowed Functions & Compilation
The project specifies allowed functions and compilation commands for the shell's development and testing.

Academic Integrity & Plagiarism
Participants are urged to refrain from copying or pasting code and to avoid any form of plagiarism. Violation of these guidelines will result in strict consequences.

This project emphasizes learning through individual effort and understanding. Collaboration should foster mutual comprehension of every line of code pushed to the repository.

Remember, the goal is not just to reach the solution but to comprehend the process. This project is a great opportunity to delve into the intricacies of shell creation. Best of luck and have fun!
